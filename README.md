## Problem Set 0
-I didnt have a problem with this one due to the basics I have learnt them during bootcamp so it was all smooth sailing.

## Problem Set 1
-Same here I was just gliding through the problem set like it was nothing, but it really improved the way see all funtions and conditions as how should they be used to their fullest potential.

## Problem Set 2
- It was a little bit of for me due to I kind of forgot how to use a while loop but the notes really helped me to get up to speed because I was left behind.

## Problem Set 3
- This is where the headache began because I had to do so much that my eyes couldnt keep track with my mind and a lot of research went behind ValueErrors and TRY and ELSE.
- With all that research it paid off because I was able to comlete it in two unrested days, but I am glad I put the hard work in but still have to practice it more because even though I did   the work I still feel I havent grasped the whole concept of lECTURE 3 so I am going to dive deep into it.
